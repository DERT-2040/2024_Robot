#### Description:
Currently, we have one functioning RIO, we have another one that works ok, but does have issues. And then we have three other RIOs:

S/N:
- 306AD51
- 306CE1C
- 30E6A7B

All with assorted issues. To replace them we have to prove that we tried all other methods of recovery on them. Then we can send them in to be replaced. 

Here is a message from support trying to point us in the right direction:

I hope you are doing well! My name is Diego and I'll be assisting you in this thread.

About the RIOs we have the following input

1. The first RIO we understand that it's currently working, can we keep working with this RIO so we can confirm that it does not show the error anymore? ()
2. With the second RoboRIO, (306CE1C)

	1. can we try to connect to it over the ethernet port.
	2. Hold down the reset button for 5-10 seconds to enter into safemode. The light will be flashing once we are there
	3. Then update the firmware and then re-image
	4. Run any test

2. What do you mean byÂ "The USB-B port is broken"? (306AD51)

	1. We could also try the steps for the second roborio using the ethernet port

The other RIO is not mentioned, I do not recall why, it probably needs to be proven to work as well though.
