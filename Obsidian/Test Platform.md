## Requirements:
###  â€¢ [[RIO Refurbish]]
## Friends:

 A test platform is needed because the robot will almost always be tied up in tuning or new inter-system development while this test platform could be used for intra-system development. Right now we have the battery box, but there is not a good way to connect the battery to controllers, and it is not connected to a RIO or radio, so programming on it is hard. This will also let programmers work on testing two systems at once while not having to beg to have their system on the robot for 10-15 minutes.
