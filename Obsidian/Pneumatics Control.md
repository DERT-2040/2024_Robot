## Requirements:
###  â€¢ [[Test Platform]]
## Friends:


In the past our policy was that there would be no pneumatics because at some point in the past we ran out of battery on the field when using it. Out job should be to get basic pneumatics control tested and working before the start of next season. This is important because it could be incredibly useful in the next game.

We need a test platform for this though, a simple setup where mechanical or a sub-team of electrical could test on components or a small mechanism.
