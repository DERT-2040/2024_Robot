#### Other Components:
As far as components, I don't think it would be a bad idea to buy this: [AMAZON LINK](https://www.amazon.com/12V-50A-600W-Power-Transformer/dp/B09NJLNYKH/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3V3MWIKB0RCA&keywords=12v%2Bpower%2Bsupply%2B40a&qid=1689301855&sprefix=12v%2Bpower%2Bsupply%2B40a%2Caps%2C104&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1). It is 12v 40-50 amp max. So we could theoretically draw the maximum amount of current from a single breaker on the PDP, otherwise it would be more than enough for other functions and could just be plugged in, no battery changing.

Other than that, we need a RIO, a VRM, a PDP, a Spark, a Talon, a place for air compressor, and a PCM. CAD should build a pretty enclosure because this will be used a lot.
